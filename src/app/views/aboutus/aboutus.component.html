                                     WilloDairy: forward thinking and innovative, taking the latest technology available to bring comfort to people that have 
                                     lost a loved one, so information and memories can be shared and kept for future generations. Personal messages can be left 
                                     to family and friends, leaving a lasting catalogue of information for people to refer to time and time again. This would be 
                                     in the way of video clips, letters, favourite song and giving the users the option of creating personal playlist, which can 
                                     be downloaded by loved ones.

                                     We will also provide a section where the user can state whoever they would like their personal belongings
                                      and keep safes to go to, which may not be typically included in a traditional will.
